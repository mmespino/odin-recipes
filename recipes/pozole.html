            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Pozole is a traditional Mexican dish. While there is red Pozole, I think it is better to make white Pozole and have the spicy sauce as a side which can be added to white Pozole and mixed to the individual's taste.</p>

            <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the pork, onion, head of garlic, and fresh oregano in a large pot and add enough water to cover it by about 2 inches.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, skimming off any foam that forms in the pot.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer, cover, and cook until the pork is fork tender, about 90 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the pork pieces to a platter. Once cool enough to handle, separate the meat, discarding bones and skin.</li>
                <li>Add meat back to the stew.</li>
                <li>Drain canned hominy and add hominy plus Mexican oregano to the stew.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking at a simmer until flavors blend, for another hour.</li>
                <li>Serve in a deep bowl and use dried oregano, quartered limes, and cubed avocados for garnish to personal taste.</li>
            </ol>
